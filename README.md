### UniBorg Configuration

The UniBorg Config is situated in `userbot/uniborgConfig.py`.

**Heroku Configuration**
Simply just leave the Config as it is.

**Local Configuration**
Fortunately there are no Mandatory vars for the UniBorg Support Config.

## Mandatory Vars

- Only two of the environment variables are mandatory.
- This is because of `telethon.errors.rpc_error_list.ApiIdPublishedFloodError`
    - `APP_ID`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
    - `API_HASH`:   You can get this value from https://my.telegram.org
- The userbot will not work without setting the mandatory vars.
